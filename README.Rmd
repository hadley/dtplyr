## Overview

dtplyr provides a dplyr backend for [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki). Compared to the previous release, this version of dtplyr focusses only on lazy evaluation triggered by use of `lazy_dt()`. This means that no computation is performed until you explicitly request it with `as.data.table()`, `as.data.frame()` or `as_tibble()`. This has a considerable advantage over the previous version (which eagerly evaluated each step) because it allows dtplyr to generate significantly more performant translations.

This is a large change that breaks all existing uses of dtplyr. But frankly, dtplyr was pretty useless before because it did such a bad job of generating data.table code. Fortunately few people used it for this reason, making a major overhaul possible.

See `vignette("translation")` for details of the current translations, and  [table.express](https://github.com/asardaes/table.express) and [rqdatatable](https://github.com/WinVector/rqdatatable/) for related work.

## Installation

You can install from CRAN with:

```R
install.packages("dtplyr")
```

Or try the development version from GitHub with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/dtplyr")
```

## Usage

To use dtplyr, I recommend loading data.table, dtplyr, and dplyr:

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(dtplyr)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

Then use `lazy_dt()` to create a "lazy" data table that tracks the operations performed on it. 

```{r}
mtcars2 <- lazy_dt(mtcars)
```

You can preview the transformation (including the generated data.table code) by printing the result:

```{r}
mtcars2 %>% 
  filter(wt < 5) %>% 
  mutate(l100k = 235.21 / mpg) %>% # liters / 100 km
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(l100k = mean(l100k))
```

But generally you should reserve this only for debugging, and use `as.data.table()`, `as.data.frame()`, or `as_tibble()` to indicate that you're done with the transformation and want to access the results:

```{r}
mtcars2 %>% 
  filter(wt < 5) %>% 
  mutate(l100k = 235.21 / mpg ) %>% # liters / 100 km
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  summarise(l100k = mean(l100k)) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

Note that this doesn't generate exactly the same results as when applied to a data.frame, because data.table doesn't sort groups by default. If you do want sorted groups, you can instead use `key_by()`, but it's worth remembering that dtplyr is a  translation layer, so like [dbplyr](http://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) it can't guarantee that the results are exactly equal.

## Why is dtplyr slower than data.table?

There are three primary reasons that dtplyr will always be somewhat slower than data.table:

* Each dplyr verb must do some computation to convert dplyr syntax to 
  data.table syntax. This takes time proportional to the complexity of 
  the input code, not the input _data_, so should be a negligible overhead
  for large datasets.

* Some data.table expressions have no direct dplyr equivalent. For example,
  `X[Y, sum(foo*bar)]` selects the relevant variables _before_ joining. 
  The dplyr equivalent, `X %>% left_join(Y) %>% summarise(sum(foo * bar))`,
  carries along all variables in the join. Similarly, there's no efficient
  way to express cross- or rolling-joins with dplyr verbs.

* To match dplyr semantics, `mutate()` does not modify in place by default. 
  This means that most expression involving `mutate()` needs to make a copy
  that would not be necessary if you were using data.table directly.
  (You can opt out of this behaviour with `immutable = FALSE`).
